# Music Match Game

Music Matchâ„¢ is a game that puts your memory to the test! Modeled after a "concentration" memory game, players must turn over pairs of cards that feature pictures of different music-related paraphernalia (instruments, CDs, etc.)

During their turn, a player must select from two of 16 blank cards in hopes of turning up a match. 

If the cards result in a match, the matching cards will remain turned over until the game ends; if there is no match, the cards will be turned back over and a new turn will begin. 

Gameplay continues until players match all of the cards.

### _Pseudocode_

1. If 'start' button is clicked
    shuffle card images using some paradigm like Fisher-Yates

   If 'stop' button is clicked
    reset gameplay interface

2. If any picture in the array is clicked, reveal the image underneath

3. If picture1 and picture2 do not match
    return images to blank state

4. If two pictures are clicked and match, 
    leave the picture turned over

5. Once images are all matched
    alert() user "Music Matches found. Congrats!" once all matches are found and user wins
