# Music Match Game

Music Matchâ„¢ is a game that puts your memory to the test! Modeled after a "concentration" card matching game, players must turn over pairs of cards that feature pictures of different music-related paraphernalia (instruments, CDs, etc.)

Inspired by its creators love for all things music, the game is a musical spin on the classic game, featuring hand-sketched cards.

During their turn, a player must select from two of 16 blank cards in hopes of turning up a match. 

If the cards result in a match, the matching cards will remain turned over until the game ends; if there is no match, the cards will be turned back over and a new turn will begin. 

Gameplay continues until players match all of the cards. Upon starting the game, all cards are shuffled and their location is determined randomly.
